# Software-Development-Lifecycle

1.	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   
Interpreting user needs starts with understanding what the customer actually wants and turning that into something actionable. In our Agile travel project, user stories helped me translate those needs into clear goals the team could work toward. Writing stories like “As a traveler, I want to see top destinations so I can plan my next trip” gave us direction and helped prioritize what mattered most. It kept the focus on the user experience and made it easier to plan our sprints around real value rather than assumptions.

2.	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   
When developing programs, I like to approach it as a process of steady progress rather than one big push to the finish line. Using Agile methods such as sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives helped our team stay organized and adaptable. We focused on smaller, functional pieces that could be improved with each iteration instead of waiting until everything was “perfect.” Going forward, I plan to keep using Agile practices like backlog refinement and sprint reviews to stay flexible, encourage teamwork, and maintain continuous improvement.

3.	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   
To me, being a good team member means being reliable, communicating clearly, and supporting others when challenges come up. In our project, collaboration made all the difference. Each person brought unique skills, and it was important to listen, share ideas, and stay open to feedback. As Scrum Master, I worked to keep everyone aligned and make sure obstacles didn’t slow us down. Being a good teammate in software development means staying focused on the shared goal, contributing to the group’s success, and keeping the user’s needs in mind throughout the process.
